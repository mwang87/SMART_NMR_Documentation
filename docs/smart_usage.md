## How to process a raw HSQC spectrum to a NMR table with MestreNova

1. Open your raw HSQC spectrum in MestreNova
- Drag&Drop your HSQC file (for Bruker data you find your spectrum under: pdata/1/2rr)
- Depending on purity and concentration of your sample and aquisition time your
spectrum looks more or less clean and may need additional processing (see 2.)

2. For processing your HSQC spectrum click on 'Processing' tab
- click on 'Auto Phase Correction' (optional: correct manually)
- click on 'Auto Baseline Correction'
- click on 'More Processing' --> click on 'Reduce t1 noise'
You should see a clean spectrum now.

3.  Annotate HSQC spectrum with chemical shifts (1H,13C)
- click on 'Analysis' tab
- reference your spectrum to residual solvent peaks or other reference points such as TMS signal (optional as SMART recognizes the relative position of all correlations)
- click on Auto Peak Picking (Important: Check by manually adding missed peaks and removing duplicated, nonsense and solvent peak annotations).
Now each peak should be annotated with two numbers separated by comma (1H, 13C chemical shifts)

4. Generate NMR table from annotated HSQC spectrum
- click on 'Analysis' tab
- click on 'NMR Peaks Table'
- move the f2 column to the left of the f1 column
- copy all (ctrl+A)
- click on 'copy peaks' and choose 'copy table'

- open Excel or similar program and paste the table (ctrl+V)

- align table in such a way that all values of f2 dimension = 1H are in one column and all values of the f1 dimension = 13C are in another column next to it

- open a new excel document (ctrl+N)
- type in column A1: '1H' and in column B1: '13C'
- copy and paste the table so that all values with 1H data are in column A2-AX and all values with 13C data are in column B2-BXX

- reduce number of decimals for 13C from 2 to 1 (for example 123.9 instead of 123.87).
- mark your table + header (1H,13C) and save as comma-separated file (.csv).

## User's Guide for SMART 2.0 Analysis

Welcome to use the SMART 2.0 to test your compound(s). 

The current version of SMART 2.0 as of 11/25/2019 consists of 2D NMR spectra from 53,076 natural products. 

Before you start, pleaes unblock any pop-up blockers in your web browser.

Please checkout the server at [SMART 2.0](https://smart.ucsd.edu/classic).

## Input Data Formatting

Please prepare your NMR peak lists of each compound using Excel or preferably notepad/wordpad and save the NMR table of each compound as a comma-separated value (.csv) or tab-separated (.tsv) file. If you are using Microsoft Excel, this can be done by click "save as" and then choose the two file types. Please always place 1H data in the first column and their corresponding 13C data in the second column. The first row will be left for strings “1H” and “13C” as table head. Please strictly keep 1H shifts in 2 decimals and 13C shifts in a single decimal only. You can name the .csv file with any name that your operating system accepts.

|     1H     |     13C     |
|:----------:|:-----------:|
|    3.00    |     29.0    |
|    3.40    |     29.0    |
|    5.00    |     57.6    |
|    5.60    |     59.4    |
|    1.80    |     19.2    |
|    5.17    |     57.4    |
|    7.49    |    129.0    |
|    7.51    |    130.5    |
|    7.47    |    131.4    |

In the NMR table files, wherever there are diastereotopic protons on a methylene carbon (i.e., CH2 with two distinct proton shifts), please add a separate entry for both the carbon and proton:

|     1H     |     13C     |
|:----------:|:-----------:| 
| 3.12       | 43.2        |
| 3.40       | 43.2        | 

After the .csv (or .tsv) file is ready, simply upload it to the first window by drag&drop. You can submit multiple jobs at one time. The result will show up in the next webpage as images with chemical structures, compound names, similarity scores, and molecular weights. The Top 10 hits are ranked by similarity scores. You can download the result by clicking the “download results” icon.
